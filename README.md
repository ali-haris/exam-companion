## About
**Exam Companion** is an AI-driven study planner designed to help students prepare efficiently for exams by creating **personalized study schedules**.  
It assists learners in breaking down topics, managing time, and staying organizedâ€”reducing exam stress and boosting confidence.  

This project supports the **Education for All** theme by making effective study planning accessible to anyone with internet access, regardless of background or resources.

## Problem
Many students struggle with:
- Overwhelming amount of material to cover  
- Poor time management before exams  
- Stress from uncertainty about preparation progress  
- Difficulty balancing study with personal schedules  

Without a clear plan, students waste valuable time and lose focus.

---

## Solution
Exam Companion automates study planning:
1. **Parses** course content from PDFs or pasted text.  
2. **Calculates** available study time based on userâ€™s exam date & busy hours.  
3. **Generates** a customized daily schedule using AI.  
4. **Exports** the schedule to PDF or Google Calendar for easy tracking.  

The result is a realistic, stress-free study plan tailored to each studentâ€™s life.
